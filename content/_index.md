# Occlu-FER Dataset

## Dataset Description

To facilitate specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions, we construct the first occlusion dataset named **Occlu-FER**, which focuses on partial facial occlusion and extraneous face interference in real-world scenarios. This dataset covers eight basic emotion categories. The training dataset consists of **6,838 images**, and the validation dataset includes **880 images**. The image sources of the dataset include both occlusion samples from public in-the-wild datasets and real-world facial photographs collected from the internet. The Occlu-FER dataset could serve as a crucial benchmark for future research in related fields.
